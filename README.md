This is my code for the Rock Paper Scissors Project for the Odin Project. Still very hard for me to do. 

Rock blunts scissors
Paper covers rock
Scissors cut paper

The game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. I will use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.
